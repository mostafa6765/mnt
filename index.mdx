Excellent ‚Äî let‚Äôs dive into **Module 1: Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** üß†

This module lays the foundation. You‚Äôll understand what OOP _really_ is ‚Äî not just syntax, but mindset and design philosophy.

---

## üß© **Module 1: Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming**

### üéØ **Learning Objectives**

By the end of this module, you‚Äôll be able to:

- Understand the **concept and purpose** of OOP
- Differentiate **procedural vs object-oriented programming**
- Describe and identify the **four pillars** of OOP
- Create your **first simple class and object** in Python and Java

---

## 1. What is OOP?

**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** is a programming paradigm based on the concept of **objects**, which represent **real-world entities** (like `Car`, `Employee`, `BankAccount`).

Each object combines:

- **Data (attributes)** ‚Üí variables
- **Behavior (methods)** ‚Üí functions

OOP helps you model real systems and keep code modular, maintainable, and extensible.

---

### üèóÔ∏è **Analogy: Real-World View**

Think of a **Car**:

- Attributes ‚Üí `color`, `model`, `speed`
- Methods ‚Üí `start()`, `accelerate()`, `brake()`

The **class** is the blueprint.\
The **object** is the actual car built from that blueprint.

---

## 2. Procedural vs Object-Oriented

| Feature   | Procedural                  | Object-Oriented             |
| :-------- | :-------------------------- | :-------------------------- |
| Structure | Sequence of steps/functions | Objects interacting         |
| Focus     | Actions (functions)         | Entities (objects)          |
| Data      | Exposed globally            | Encapsulated inside objects |
| Example   | C, early Python             | Java, C++, modern Python    |

---

## 3. Four Pillars of OOP

OOP stands on four main principles:

1. **Encapsulation** ‚Üí binding data + methods together
2. **Abstraction** ‚Üí hiding complexity, showing essentials
3. **Inheritance** ‚Üí reusing existing class behavior
4. **Polymorphism** ‚Üí one interface, many forms

(We‚Äôll explore each one in its own module later.)

---

## 4. Classes and Objects

A **class** defines the _blueprint_ of an object.\
An **object** is an _instance_ of that class.

---

### üêç **Python Example**

```
# Define a simple class
class Car:
    def __init__(self, brand, model):
        self.brand = brand
        self.model = model

    def start(self):
        print(f"{self.brand} {self.model} is starting...")

# Create objects
car1 = Car("Tesla", "Model S")
car2 = Car("Toyota", "Corolla")

car1.start()
car2.start()
```

**Output:**

```
Tesla Model S is starting...
Toyota Corolla is starting...
```

---

### ‚òï **Java Example**

```
class Car {
    String brand;
    String model;

    Car(String brand, String model) {
        this.brand = brand;
        this.model = model;
    }

    void start() {
        System.out.println(brand + " " + model + " is starting...");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car car1 = new Car("Tesla", "Model S");
        Car car2 = new Car("Toyota", "Corolla");

        car1.start();
        car2.start();
    }
}
```

**Output:**

```
Tesla Model S is starting...
Toyota Corolla is starting...
```

---

## 5. Why OOP Matters for Engineers

- ‚úÖ Better **code organization**
- ‚úÖ Easier **maintenance and scaling**
- ‚úÖ Promotes **reuse** (inheritance, composition)
- ‚úÖ Ideal for **large teams and complex systems**
- ‚úÖ Enables **real-world modeling**

---

## 6. Quick Practice Exercise

üëâ **Challenge:**\
Write a Python or Java class named `Book` that includes:

- attributes: `title`, `author`, `price`
- method: `get_info()` ‚Üí prints the book info

Then, create 2 book objects and print their details.
